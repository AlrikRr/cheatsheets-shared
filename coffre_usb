# Coffre USB
*Desc: How create a LUKS USB device using cryptseup*

- install cryptsetup
- install pv **optional**


## Know your device
Check the name of your device.
- `# fdisk -l`
Let's say for this tutorial, we'll use **sdb1** from the sdb disk.

## Erase data
- Brute mode `# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb1 bs=1M`
- Hard-core mode `# badblocks -c 10240 -s -w -t random -v /dev/sdb1`

**optional**
Using pv so that way you have a progress bar
- `# pv -tpreb /dev/zero | dd of=/dev/sdb1 bs=1M`

## Cryptsetup

- `# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1`

Open the Luks device
- `# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 usb_crypt`

## Typefile

- `# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/usb_crypt`
OR
- `# mkfs.fat /dev/mapper/usb_crypt`
OR
- `# mke2fs /dev/mapper/usb_crypt`

Finish !

## Pro-Tips - 1
If you don't have the permissions to write data on the disk, try :
- `# sudo chown -R [username] /media/[username]/[UUID]/`

## Pro-Tips - 2
Sometimes it's append that the disk is not mounted automatically and you can't enter a passphrase on the message-box.

**Open the luks**
- cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 usb_crypt

**mount the luks**
- mount /dev/mapper/usb_crypt /media/[username]/usb_crypt

**umount the luks**
- umount /media/[username]/usb_crypt

**Close the luks**
- cryptsetup luksClose usb_crypt

## Pro-Tips - 3
- Backing up your laptop to an SD Card in the same laptop is #notabackup
- Backing up to a hard drive that is 6 inches away from your computer is #notabackup
- Backing up your Gmail to another Gmail account is #notabackup
- Backing up your book by copying it to another folder is #notabackup
- The photos that are still in your camera memory are #notabackup

- 3 copies of anything you care about - Two isn't enough if it's important.
- 2 different formats - HDD + SSD or HHD + USB
- 1 off-site backup - If the house burns down, how will you get your memories back?
